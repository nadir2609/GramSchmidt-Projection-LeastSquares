# Math4AI ‚Äì Linear Algebra Assignment 5

This project implements three key linear algebra algorithms fundamental to AI and machine learning:

1. **Gram-Schmidt Process** ‚Äì Generates an orthonormal basis from a set of linearly independent vectors.  
2. **Projection Matrix** ‚Äì Constructs \( P = A(A^T A)^{-1}A^T \) to project vectors onto a subspace.  
3. **Least Squares Solver** ‚Äì Solves \( \hat{x} = (A^T A)^{-1}A^T b \) to find the best-fit solution when no exact solution exists.

These implementations were coded **from scratch** using Python and NumPy to deepen understanding of how these mathematical tools connect to AI concepts like feature decorrelation, projection, and regression.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nadir2609/GramSchmidt-Projection-LeastSquares.git
cd GramSchmidt-Projection-LeastSquares
````

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv env1
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

* **Windows:**

  ```bash
  env1\Scripts\activate
  ```
* **macOS / Linux:**

  ```bash
  source env1/bin/activate
  ```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project

Each script can be run independently:

```bash
python gram_schmidt.py
python projection_matrix.py
python least_squares.py
```

These scripts demonstrate:

* **Orthonormalization (Gram-Schmidt)**
* **Vector projection onto subspaces**
* **Least squares regression for best-fit solutions**

---

## üß† Conceptual Links

* **Gram-Schmidt** ‚Üí produces uncorrelated (orthogonal) feature sets
* **Projection Matrix** ‚Üí projects data into a subspace
* **Least Squares** ‚Üí finds the closest possible solution (best fit)

Together, they illustrate how linear algebra underpins many AI methods, especially in model fitting and dimensionality reduction.
